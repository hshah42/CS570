!@#$%^&*When Margaret Newsum saw the news that the Camp Fire was not far from her home, the 93-year-old knew she'd have to evacuate.

But her caregiver wasn't around that morning to take her. And when Newsum went to call for help, her electricity shut off and phone service went down.
So she got her medicine and other vital needs together and walked out of her home in Magalia, California, hoping somebody would come by and help her. Salvation soon came in the form of a garbage truck.
"I was standing there when I looked up and saw this great, big, green monster truck barreling down the street," Newsum told CNN.
Around that time, Dane Ray Cummings, a Waste Management driver, had been told to cut his trash collection route short and head home as the Camp Fire neared. But he wanted to finish his route, and he had a mind to check on some houses with elderly or disabled residents.

Cummings drove up to find Newsum waiting for him. And once he realized she needed to evacuate, he knew what he had to do.
"He said you're going with me," Newsum recalled.
